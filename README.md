> Manipulator of Time

Initial version is basically a chess timer.

- For use in mobile, put at flat surface
- Two canvas, each has timer, facing each player
- Detect device orientation use Accelerometer API
- Tap canvas to pause current player's timer, next player's timer resumed
- What to do on timer end?
- How to set initial time?

TODO

- [ ] Implement canvas
- [ ] ~~Implement device orientation API~~ quite complicated
- [ ] Testing
